                        <p class="talk-description">Generative AI is not only revolutionizing language processing but is also transforming scientific fields such as biology and chemistry, as exemplified by the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In this talk, we explore three paradigms for functional protein design: sequence-based, geometry-based, and sequence/structure co-design. We introduce recent advanced generative AI models following these paradigms—IsEMPro, SurfPro, EnzyGen, and PPDiff—along with their sample-efficient learning methodologies. Additionally, we highlight four impactful applications: designing enzymes with biocatalytic functions, optimizing proteins for specific fitness goals, developing protein-protein binders, and creating antimicrobial peptides. We will also introduce InstructPro, a large protein model that follows instructions in human language and generates proteins binding to ligands. By emphasizing the powerful synergies between AI and molecular sciences, this talk seeks to inspire collaboration and drive advancements at the forefront of drug discovery, material innovation, and sustainable chemical manufacturing.</p>

                        <p class="talk-description">Applying AI to scientific problems such as weather forecasting and aerodynamics is an active research area, promising to help speed up scientific discovery and improved engineering design. Typically, these applications involve modeling complex spatiotemporal processes governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) defined on continuous domains and at multiple scales, essentially learning mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Traditional deep learning methods, however, map between finite-dimensional vector spaces. Neural operators overcome this limitation by generalizing deep learning to learn mappings directly between function spaces, enabling them to effectively replace traditional PDE solvers while offering substantial speed improvements, often several orders of magnitude faster. In this talk, I will introduce the fundamental concepts behind neural operators, illustrate their effectiveness on practical problems such as weather forecasting, and briefly discuss how computational efficiency can be further enhanced using tensor algebraic methods. Finally, I will touch on practical implementation aspects in Python, demonstrating how these concepts can be applied in practice using open-source software.</p>

                        <p class="talk-description">AI has tremendous potential for accelerating science---helping researchers access the literature, analyze data, execute experiments, and more. Asta, a project at the Allen Institute for AI, aims to deliver comprehensive scientific assistants that support all aspects of a scientific workflow.  Rigorously evaluating such systems is a fundamental challenge, which led us to develop AstaBench, a holistic benchmark suite and leaderboard spanning the scientific discovery process.  The work includes evaluations for scientific “deep research” systems, introducing methods for measuring coverage and precision of both answers and their attributions. Fully realizing AI's potential for scientists will require breakthroughs in scalable supervision, robust evaluation, and personalized and proactive assistance.  To facilitate progress toward these goals, the Asta project provides open-source corpora, tools, and APIs.</p>
